    overview: [
      'Structured-light scanning projects a series of coded fringe patterns onto an object and recovers its 3D shape from how those patterns deform. It is one of the most accurate ways to digitize small physical objects — but that accuracy only holds if every stage of the geometry pipeline, from calibration to registration, is tightly controlled.',
      'This project focused on the **post-calibration** side of a dual-camera structured-light system: taking raw captured fringe images and calibration targets, and turning them into a clean, metrically accurate point cloud with a **verifiable** accuracy figure — the kind of number you can actually put in an acceptance report.',

      'High-precision structured-light scanning demands sub-millimeter geometric accuracy and robust pose recovery. The challenge: turn raw calibrated captures into a reliable geometry pipeline whose accuracy can actually be measured and trusted.',

      'Implemented **PnP-based pose estimation** with **ICP relocalization**, producing stable, drift-free registration across all scanning views.',

    techDetails: [
      'Circle centers on the calibration target are extracted at sub-pixel precision, then matched under the **epipolar constraint** so correspondences stay geometrically consistent between the two cameras.',
      'Camera pose is recovered with **PnP** from the 2D–3D correspondences, and **ICP** relocalizes each new scan against the accumulated geometry so multi-view captures fuse without drift.',
      'For validation, standard metrology spheres of known diameter are scanned; fitting spheres to the result and measuring **sphere-center distance error** gives an objective, repeatable accuracy metric.',
    ],

      'Achieved a **0.023 mm** standard-sphere center-distance error, well within the tolerance expected of high-precision small-object scanning.',
